Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Try to make your pull request as descriptive as possible, especially the title. "Update Readme.md" makes it harder for us to see directly what your pull request is about.
- Use the KISS principle for descriptions.
- Titles should be [capitalized](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html).
- Please check your grammar and spelling as much as possible.
- Make sure your text editor is setup correctly and doesn't adjust spaces and/or tabs.
- Improvements and additions to the existing content are always welcome.
- The application should follow enough of the [KDE Visual Design Group/HIG](https://hig.kde.org/).
- Please avoid unmaintained items. 
- Please label official KDE Projects.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
